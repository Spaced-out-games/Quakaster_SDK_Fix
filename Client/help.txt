Goals for today:

Finish qk::Layer to also respond to on_attach() and on_detach()
Begin porting the integrated console from an older iteration of the engine
Create the first (and possibly only) layer included in the engine
UILayer	= { UIContext, Client& }
	Implement on_attach(), on_event(), draw() and on_detach()


Need to decouple the layer status shit. Make it fire events via entt::dispatcher instead, and have the Client (who has an Application&) react to it.





Actor = {std::vector <entt::entity>, entt::registry& (from Client)}

Scene = {entt::registry, std::vector<Actor>}

Client = {Server* (upgrade to ports in due time), ConvarRegistry, entt::dispatcher, Scene }
